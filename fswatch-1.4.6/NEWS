    scripts invoked by the GNU Build System.

  * fswatch does not compile on OS X < 10.9 because some required C++11 classes
    are not supported by the C++ runtime.

New in 1.4.1:

  * Remove usages of C++11 initializer lists so that fswatch builds with older
    compiler.

New in 1.3.6:

  * fswatch-run scripts are provided for ZSH and Bash.
  * System is scanned during installation to check for ZSH and Bash
    availability.  Path of found shells is substituted in the corresponding
    scripts, otherwise the default /bin/[shell] is used.
  * If a supported shell is found, the fswatch-run symbolic link is created in
    the installation directory to the corresponding script.  The lookup order
    of the shells is:
    - ZSH.
    - Bash.

    versions and launch the specified command when change events are received.

New in 1.3.2:

  * fswatch has been merged with fsw (https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fsw).
